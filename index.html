        I'm so excited about my new career path and the ability to pursue my passion for helping people in a new way! In the past I have tried different ways to make a living, but nothing has satisfied my hunger for "bigger and better me" completely. I always felt like something was missing, always thirsty for more...!

        Then a good friend of mine kept telling me about web-development and how much he enjoys it. I was curious, but so <strong>far</strong> away from being "techy". And everytime he tried to talk me into it, I was too scared to make that leap into the unknown, it's like falling out of the airplane without a parachute or driving in the car at 120mph down a steep mountain road. Well you can only imagine what it's like!

            <li>Laravel</li>
            <li>Express.js</li>
